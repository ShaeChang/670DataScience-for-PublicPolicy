"0","# To conclude, from the result we can see, the third model (k = n) results in the highest accuracy in this case. Also, considering the workload, the first model should be the easiest one and the thrid model should be the toughest one, because you could only take a look at the one nearest value in the treatment data set and come to the conclusion in the first model, but should calculate the all n values in the treatment data set and come up with the distance, and eventually decide rather there exists rat burrow or not, that makes the work tough in the third model."
